3. Clearly describe the issue, including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.

### Suggesting Enhancements

1. Check the GitHub issues to see if it's already been suggested.
2. If not, create a new issue.
3. Use a clear and descriptive title.
4. Provide a detailed description of the suggested enhancement.
5. Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most users.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.

## Style Guide

### YAML Files

### Markdown Files

- Use proper header hierarchy (# for main title, ## for sections, etc.).

- Keep line length to a maximum of 120 characters for better readability.

## Adding New Examples

When adding new examples:

1. Create a new directory if it's a new category.
2. Include a README.md in the directory explaining the examples.
